# hello-world
This is a repository but I don't know what I'm repositing.

A little about myself.  
I am a novice. 
I took the first HTML/CSS class on Khan Academy, and there are more, I've got a bunch of courses lined up on Udemy (some of which seem to be much better than others), I don't really understand what GitHub is but it keeps coming up so here I am trying to figure it out.  There are seemingly endless resources in this field.
I started out to become proficient in WordPress and and found myself here. And a number of other places.   I'm trying to discover what it is I'm trying to discover.  I want to learn but there are so many options that it's a bit overwhelming. But every day it all seems to make a bit more sense.  There are a lot of routes available so I'm just going to keep studying, figuring the more I learn the clearer my path will become.
