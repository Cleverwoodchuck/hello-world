# hello-world
This is a repository but I don't know what I'm repositing.

A little about myself.  
I am a novice. 
I took the first HTML/CSS class on Khan Academy, and there are more, I've got a bunch of courses lined up on Udemy (some of which seem to be much better than others), I don't really understand what GitHub is but it keeps coming up so here I am trying to figure it out.
I started out looking in to WordPress and becoming proficient there and found myself here and a number of other places.  Most of these places I end up because I'm not sure of what my goal is. This is what I'm trying to discover.  There are a lot of routes available so I'm just going to keep studying, figuring the more I learn the clearer my path will become.
I've learned that learning to code then coding to create seems to be the philosophy (i.e. the classes and certificates offered don't mean much in and of themselves). But at the same time I have to learn somewhere. Any input here is welcome.
